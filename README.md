sfz
===
sfz files for several sample libraries, mainly sonatina symphonic orchestra

TODO:
* upload samples somewhere
* g-town is still in the experimental phase

sonatina:
* sample folder names remove spaces and lowercase and change the sfz files content accordingly
* loop points
* extend range
* remove transposition from some instruments
* try out other ampeg_release=2 //Fade out settings
* samples: solo flute: samples are mistakenly labeled an octave lower; the sfz file addresses the error and plays correctly; however, it would also be desirable to correct the labeling of the samples; once this is done, the sfz file will have to be edited again to address the change
* solo bassoon: LinuxSampler plays F8-G9 as C#5
